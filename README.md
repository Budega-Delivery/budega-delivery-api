### About Bugeda Project

Budega is a fullstack solution developed to complete the postgraduate course at the Pontifical Catholic University (PUC-MG) in the [`Fullstack Web Development`](https://www.pucminas.br/PucVirtual/Pos-Graduacao/Paginas/Desenvolvimento-Web-Full-Stack.aspx) course.

### Inspiration

With the health tragedy resulting from the covid-19 pandemic, several small businesses in peripheral neighborhoods needed to carry out their sales and deliveries online. Budega emerged to help the community solve this problem.
